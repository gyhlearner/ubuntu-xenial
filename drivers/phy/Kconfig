config GENERIC_PHY
	bool "PHY Core"
	help
	  Generic PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which phy drivers can create PHY using the phy framework and
	  phy users can obtain reference to the PHY. All the users of this
	  framework should select this config.

config PHY_LPC18XX_USB_OTG
	tristate "NXP LPC18xx/43xx SoC USB OTG PHY driver"
	depends on OF && (ARCH_LPC18XX || COMPILE_TEST)
	depends on MFD_SYSCON
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support NXP LPC18xx/43xx internal USB OTG PHY.

	  This driver is need for USB0 support on LPC18xx/43xx and takes
	  care of enabling and clock setup.

config PHY_PISTACHIO_USB
	tristate "IMG Pistachio USB2.0 PHY driver"
	depends on MACH_PISTACHIO
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB2.0 PHY on the IMG Pistachio SoC.

config PHY_XGENE
	tristate "APM X-Gene 15Gbps PHY support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM && OF && (ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST)
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  This option enables support for APM X-Gene SoC multi-purpose PHY.

config PHY_STIH407_USB
	tristate "STMicroelectronics USB2 picoPHY driver for STiH407 family"
	depends on RESET_CONTROLLER
	depends on ARCH_STI || COMPILE_TEST
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this support to enable the picoPHY device used by USB2
	  and USB3 controllers on STMicroelectronics STiH407 SoC families.

config PHY_STIH41X_USB
	tristate "STMicroelectronics USB2 PHY driver for STiH41x series"
	depends on ARCH_STI
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB transceiver that is part of
	  STMicroelectronics STiH41x SoC series.

config PHY_QCOM_UFS
	tristate "Qualcomm UFS PHY driver"
	depends on OF && ARCH_QCOM
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Support for UFS PHY on QCOM chipsets.

config PHY_TUSB1210
	tristate "TI TUSB1210 ULPI PHY module"
	depends on USB_ULPI_BUS
	depends on EXTCON || !EXTCON # if EXTCON=m, this cannot be built-in
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Support for TI TUSB1210 USB ULPI PHY.

config PHY_BRCMSTB_SATA
	tristate "Broadcom STB SATA PHY driver"
	depends on ARCH_BRCMSTB
	depends on OF
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the SATA3 PHY on 28nm Broadcom STB SoCs.
	  Likely useful only with CONFIG_SATA_BRCMSTB enabled.

config PHY_CYGNUS_PCIE
	tristate "Broadcom Cygnus PCIe PHY driver"
	depends on OF && (ARCH_BCM_CYGNUS || COMPILE_TEST)
	select GENERIC_PHY
	default ARCH_BCM_CYGNUS
	help
	  Enable this to support the Broadcom Cygnus PCIe PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.
